- validate.bash

Simple validator for competition programming.

Use bash environment(I did not target at other sh environment because of maintain for sinmple codes).

Firstly, please edit the EXE_PASS config.

```source ./validate.bash```

Move a directory where '.in file' and '.diff' be in.

```validate```

All outputs validate for the '.diff' named same identify with diff command.
